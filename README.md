Executive Summary: The report is sorted by sales by product. The 2 products with the highest profit margin also have 68% of total sales. The company's
efforts and resources should be invested in Bamboo Grove and Imperial Poet. On the other hand, the Scholar Saison product has a very low profit margin
and ranks third in total sales by product. Further research and discussion with the marketing team is needed as to whether it makes sense to keep the item
in the company's portfolio.
