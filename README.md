The table above is sorted by total sales. The distributors are responsible for 94 Million dollars which is more than half of total sales for the fiscal year. Their gross profitranges from 9% to 16%. on the other side, After SSBC testing room, the Bars have the highest Gross Profit margin in the customer types inside the customer type, we have varied profit margins that ranges from 33% as low as 4%. It is worth it to look for opportunities in the bar segment as new incoming customer may provide a large profit.

The table above is sorted by sales by product. The 2 products with the highest profit margin also have 68% of total sales. The company's
efforts and resources should be invested in Bamboo Grove and Imperial Poet. On the other hand, the Scholar Saison product has a very low profit margin
and ranks third in total sales by product. Further research and discussion with the marketing team is needed as to whether it makes sense to keep the item
in the company's portfolio.

The Half Keg is the product type that on average is most profitable. Followed by the Keg, Six pack and the tasting room pour, on that
order. The brand name Scholar Saison have a very low per serving gross profit across all product types, in the Six pack even have a negative gross profit.

It seems there there are peak of sales in May, November and Decemenber. The Product Poet had consistence sales until may from then on, it seems the
Scholars Saison took over cannibalize those sales. The Other Products range between 400 to 800 following the sames general seasonality.
